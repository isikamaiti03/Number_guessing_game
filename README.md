#Number_guessing_game

This is a entertaining game :)
This program generates a random number between 1 to 100.If the user's guess is higher than the actual number, the program displays "lower number pls" similarly if the user's guess is lesser than the actual number,the program displays "higher number pls".
When the user guess the correct number,the program displays the number of guesses the user used to arrive at the number.
